# foodscan

I'm just trying to make a program that scan a barcode, and send back infos about the product (focusing on food product here).

I'll be using several Python modules, such as opencv (for the camera), pyzbar (to decode barcode), and I'll make requests to the [experimental API of the Open Food Facts project](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/data).

This is just for fun! (as always) :rainbow:

# TODO :
- fix pulldown menu
- add infos
- create export to text method
