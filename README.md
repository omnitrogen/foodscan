# foodscan

This program scan a barcode, and send back infos about the product (focusing on food product here).

You can then export a report of all the products scanned in html format. You will see if the product's brand is using any Monsanto product.

I'll be using several Python modules, such as opencv (for the camera), pyzbar (to decode barcode), and I'll make requests to the [experimental API of the Open Food Facts project](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/data).

If you want to try it by youself;

This is just for fun! (as always) :rainbow:
