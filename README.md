# foodscan

This program scan a barcode, and send back infos about the product (focusing on food product here).

I'll be using several Python modules, such as opencv (for the camera), pyzbar (to decode barcode), and I'll make requests to the [experimental API of the Open Food Facts project](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/data).

You can then export a report of all the scans in html format. You will see if the product's brand is using any Monsanto product.

This is just for fun! (as always) :rainbow:
